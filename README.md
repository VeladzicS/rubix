# additional information for Rubix team from the creator of this app

I have not used TypeScript before, so my plan was to first create this app using React JS without TS and then later convert it to the TS project, but I ran out of time to do that properly.
I know I could make it in TS if my schedule was not so hectic these past couple of days. I will definitely be using TS in every one of my future projects since I experienced 
the benefits of it while doing research for this project.

Thank you for the opportunity whatever you decide.

With regards,
Veladzic Senahid
